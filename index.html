      <h1>My Art Throughout My School Years</h1>
      <p>Before landing myself in the Launchcode program, for many years (from middle school to high school) I was convinced I'd be an artist and work with my artistic skills.
         My mother is an artist as well and growing up, she would always draw whatever my little sister and I wanted, along with painting our childhood bedroom Clifford themed, to taking on commissions where she'd paint a dollhouse for her friend's kids. She was also super into fixing up homes, so she did most of the house painting and fixing up around the house.</p>
      <p>Though, a certain book series <i>really</i> kicked my artistic drive into gear, starting in the 5th grade!</p>

      <p>	&nbsp;</p>

      <p>And that book series was... Warrior Cats! Some people may recognize this title if they're around my age, since this book series started in the year 2006. 
         I was in the 5th grade in the years 2009 / 2010, so I got into the series after many books had already been published by then. 
         As a tiny person who adored animals, especially cats, finding a book series about wild cats who had their own society, full of action and drama, in the woods behind a stretch of houses; it was so cool!
         So, in my last year of elementary school, the start of my art journey consisted of a lot of badly drawn cats; they filled my notebooks and my home computer's files with the use of MS Paint!

      <header>Middle School</header>
      <p>I continued to draw cats and cats and more cats in middle school, but thanks to the lovely art teacher I had (who I am friends with to this day!), she inspired me to actually try expanding my skills past what I was used to doing.
         I started to practice more realistic styles and explored many different mediums (I didn't fall in love with any at the time, but detested charcoals. I still do.)
         Thanks to my art teacher, I was able to learn and start to perfect my skills in many different mediums!

      <header>High School</header>
      <p>High school is where I told myself I needed to get my art act together. If I wanted to pursue a career in art, I needed to get better and better. No artist is ever <i>not</i> hard on themselves, but I had to be to take my skills further!
         I took almost every 2D art class offered throughout those 4 years, and even got a couple pieces in art shows throughout St. Louis!
         At the end of my high school career, I had taken AP Studio Art, where I created 12 peices each semester and submitted 12 themed pieces along with 5 other pieces to be graded by the AP Board!
         I scored a 4 (out of 5), which I'm still proud of to this day. I worked hard on all of those!

      <header>College</header>
      <p>I didn't take art as "seriously" as I did in high school. At this point I had realized I wasn't going to pursue art as a career anymore and only took art classes to fill up my credits to graduate with an Associate of Arts.
         While I did enjoy creating in college, I wasn't as passionate as I was before. I do enjoy all that I created in those few classes, but sadly didn't take many pictures of my finished pieces.
